<h1>Welcome to Mysore Palace</h1>
<p>Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and a royal residence (house).
<p> It is located in Mysore, Karnataka, India. It used to be the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. </p>
<p> Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of the Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one. </p>
<p> However, the Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the new fort.</p>


<p> The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"). Swapna built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple times. The Old Fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire, while the current fort was built of stone, bricks and wood. </p>
<p> The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt down, the current structure is also known as the New Fort. Mysore Palace is one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than six million annual visitors.</p>

<h3> LOCAL LORE</h3>
<p>Long ago, during the reign of a benevolent king, a sorcerer was said to have cast a spell to protect the palace from harm. He crafted an enchanted passageway that would remain hidden from the eyes of those who sought to do the palace harm.
Legend has it that the passage was lined with precious gems, their shimmering light casting an otherworldly glow. It was said that the passage was guarded by the spirits of the palace, loyal to the royal family even beyond their earthly lives.


Throughout the years, there have been whispers of daring adventurers who sought to uncover the passage and claim its treasures. Yet, the palace itself seemed to protect its secret, and those who ventured too close were met with mysterious happenings that deterred them from their quest.
To this day, Mysore Palace stands as a testament to its history, and the legend of the hidden passage continues to intrigue visitors. While the tale remains shrouded in mystery, it adds an element of enchantment to the palaceâ€™s already captivating presence.</p>
