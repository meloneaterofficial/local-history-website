            <h1>Welcome to Hampi</h1>
            <p>Hampi, located in the southern state of Karnataka, India, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a place of historical significance. It was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century.</p>
            <p>The ruins of Hampi are spread across a vast area, featuring stunning architecture, temples, royal structures, and bazaars. The iconic stone chariot and Virupaksha Temple are among the major attractions.</p>
            <p>Hampi was originally called Pampa-Kshetra after Hindu Deity Pampa (another name of Goddess Parvati). It is believed in Hindu mythology that Goddess Parvati led the life of a yogini in the Hemkunta hills of Hampi, to convince Shiva to marry her. So the river that flows alongside the Hemkunta hill was called the Pampa river and the land was called Pampa Khestra. The place was later called Pampe in Kannada and Hampi is the anglicized version of this name. The Pampa river is none other than the beautiful Tungabhadra river where you can now enjoy a coracle ride.</p>

      <h3> LOCAL LORE</h3>
      <p>The fourth chapter of Ramayana- Kishkindha Kanda - has some special significavce to the mythical landscape of Hampi. Rama and Lakshmana reaches Kishkinda, the kingdom of monkeys (Vanara Kingdom) . According to the local folklore, the events in this episode happened in the environs of Hampi. The geography of Hampi stand as proof for this belief.


          At the time Kishkinda itself was undergoing a turmoil of a power struggle between the monkey princes Vali and Sugreeva. The more formidable Vali chases Sugreeva out of the kingdom. He takes refuge at Matunga Hill, which Vali can not access thanks to a curse on him.
         
          Hanuman, the leader of the Sugreeva’s soldiers mistakes Rama and Lakshmana for Vali’s men. He quizzes them in disguise. On realizing it was Rama, Hanuman becomes his staunch follower of Rama.
         
          A deal finally evolves between Rama and Sugreeva. Rama kills Vali and installs Sugreeva as the king of the monkey kingdom. Hanuman prepares to fly to Lanka in search of Sita.
         
          As a tourist to Hampi, you can visit the places that are associated with this episode in Ramayana.
         
          The whole of Hampi’s landscape is attributed as the mythical kingdom of monkeys. The Anjaneya Hill , just across the river is believed to be the place where Añjana gave birth to Hanuman.</p>
