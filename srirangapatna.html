          <h1>Welcome to Srirangapatna</h1>
          <p>Srirangapatna is a town and headquarters of one of the seven Taluks of Mandya district, in the Indian State of Karnataka. </p>
          <p>It gets its name from the Ranganthaswamy temple consecrated at around 984 CE. Later, under the British rule the city was renamed to Seringapatnam. Located near the city of Mandya, it is of religious, cultural and historic importance.</p>


          <p> The monuments on the island town of Srirangapatna have been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.</p>
          <p>Srirangapatna has since time immemorial been an urban center and place of pilgrimage. During the Vijayanagar empire, it became the seat of a major viceroyalty, from where several nearby vassal states of the empire, such as Mysore and Talakad, were overseen.</p>

    <h3> LOCAL LORE</h3>
    <p>
       In the ancient town of Srirangapatna, nestled beside the river, a story has been whispered through generations. It’s said that centuries ago, during the reign of a benevolent king, an extraordinary elephant roamed the lush landscapes.
      
       This elephant, named Gajendra, was believed to possess a divine connection. Legend has it that when the king faced a grave dilemma, Gajendra would visit the king’s court, gently placing a lotus flower before him. It was said that the flower indicated a path of wisdom and clarity for the king to follow.
      
       As time passed, Gajendra’s visits became a symbol of hope for the people of Srirangapatna. They believed that the elephant’s actions were guided by the gods themselves, offering guidance during critical times.
      
       When the king faced a particularly challenging conflict, Gajendra appeared one last time, placing a lotus before him. The king followed the elephant’s wisdom, leading to a resolution that brought harmony to the kingdom.
      
       Today, the memory of Gajendra lives on in the hearts of the people of Srirangapatna. They share the tale of the sacred elephant as a reminder that even in the midst of uncertainty, signs from unexpected sources can guide us toward the path of righteousness and understanding.
